<h2>Release note HRC version 1.1 - April 2016</h2>


<h3>Summary</h3>


<p>The HRC.r1 panel has been updated to r1.1 to fix a <a href="https://imputationserver.sph.umich.edu/#!pages/hrc">known issue</a>. with the original panel. Changes include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>A set of 18 samples from the AMD cohorts were removed due to no longer having permission to use this subset of samples. The panel now consists of 32,470 samples total.</li>

  <li>After identifying a processing issue with chromosomes 9,10,11,12,13,14,15 and 17, haplotypes for these chromsosomes have been recalculated from scratch and been replaced.</li>

  <li>The minor allele count >= 5 (MAC5) cutoff has been re-applied after the above removals/replacements, hence a small number of sites previously in HRC.r1 are no longer in HRC.r1.1. The <a href="ftp://ngs.sanger.ac.uk/production/hrc/HRC.r1-1/HRC.r1-1.GRCh37.wgs.mac5.sites.vcf.gz">site list</a>    has been updated accordingly. </li>
</ol>
